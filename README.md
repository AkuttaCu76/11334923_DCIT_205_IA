### _**WEBSITE'S INTRODUTION AND PURPOSE**_   

The website is one made for the Department of Computer Science and has a number of 10 pages whivh brings to light different aspects and overview of the department. For my website, the pages include the home page, contact-us page, about-us, a page describing the events occuring in the department, the short programs or courses being held also have their own pages. Also, the is are pages each describing the Mphil, MSc and PhD programs being held at the department and also a Undergraduate and Department pages. The purpose of the information is to provide information to incoming Senionr Secondary garduates seeking information about the course they intend to do. Also current students of the department and university and also working personnels including university graduates can gain information about other courses and programs such as the short courses, MPhil, MSc and PhD programs.   

### _**STEPS TO CLONE AND SETUP THE WORKED-ON PROJECT**_  

1. Install Git on your computer if you don't already have it.  
2. Create a directory on your computer where you want the project to be cloned to. Navigate to the created directory in your terminal/command prompt.  
3. Copy the URL of the GitHub repository(project) to clone. This ends in .git usually.  
4. Type git clone  and paste the URL you copied:  
Example: **_git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git_**  
5. Press enter. This will clone the repository down to your local machine.  
6. Cd into the new project directory that was created.  
7. Install any dependencies the project needs by running a package manager like npm and or yarn for Javascript and a browser with Visualstudio Code for editing and viewing HTML and CSS files.  
8. Make a new branch to work on with the code: git checkout -b new-branch.  
9. Make the neccesary changes to code, commit changes, and push to GitHub as needed.  
10. Open a pull request on GitHub to merge your changes into the main branch.

### _**LESSON LEARNED FROM THE PROJECT**_  

Completing my lecturer's assignment of building a website for my department sharpened my practical application of core web development technologies. Crafting this multi-page web application required closely integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills toward a polished & responsive user experience.  
As I architected the site's content structure using HTML, I relied on semantic elements like header, navigation, & footer to clearly organize information. Regularly validating markup ensured I output standards-compliant code. Applying CSS, I gained nuanced control over styling and responsive design using float, flexbox & grid systems. Debugging layout issues deepened my grasp of inheritance precedences. JavaScript elevated interactivity as I handled events like filtering image galleries dynamically & launching modals. I gained valuable perspective on leveraging modern syntax & asynchronous logic.  
To sum up, this project synthesized learning across an array of fronts - structuring accessible markup, dynamically restyling presentation, binding rich components to data, responding to variable contexts. More than just a finished website, I'm taking away expanded technical competencies & deeper insight into crafting resonating user experiences by code. The hands-on process stretched my capabilities while underscoring how these fundamental building blocks interconnect in delivering web solutions.
